Recruitment Subsystem


Recruitment Subsystem Description
The Recruitment, Onboarding, Offboarding Subsystem manages the entire employee lifecycle,
from attracting and hiring talent, through integrating new employees, to facilitating structured and
compliant separations. It ensures that hiring, onboarding, and exit processes are efficient, auditable, and
integrated across HR, IT, and payroll systems.

The subsystem automates key HR activities, enhances
candidate and employee experiences, and maintains compliance with organizational and legal standards.
By connecting recruitment pipelines to onboarding workflows and offboarding checklists, it guarantees
data consistency, seamless transitions, and controlled access management throughout the employment
journey. This module is functionally divided into three core processes, which are tightly integrated with
the Employee Profile, Organizational Structure and Payroll.


Requirements

Workflow Description

The workflow represents the logical progression of activities through three interconnected phases:


Phase 1: Recruitment (REC) This phase begins with job design and posting, progresses through
candidate application, tracking, evaluation, and communication, and concludes with job offer generation
and acceptance. Successful offer acceptance automatically triggers pre-boarding tasks and transitions data
to the Onboarding phase.


Phase 2: Onboarding (ONB) The onboarding phase focuses on transforming the accepted candidate
into an active employee. It includes creating onboarding task checklists, collecting documentation, provisioning access, assigning resources, and initiating payroll and benefits. Automated notifications guideboth HR teams and new hires to ensure readiness before Day 1.


Phase 3: Offboarding (OFF) This phase manages the structured and compliant exit of employees. It
covers resignation or termination initiation, clearance workflows, access revocation, and final settlements.


Integration with payroll, IT, and facilities ensures that all assets are recovered, benefits are closed, and
access rights are securely revoked.


Together, these phases form a closed-loop lifecycle that supports continuous HR operations, linking
recruitment decisions directly to onboarding preparation and offboarding compliance. This ensures traceability, efficiency, and security across the entire employee journey.
